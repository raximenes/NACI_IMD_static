# Future Enhancements

To further evolve this base model, the following additions are recommended:

*   **RMarkdown Report**: Create an automated reporting script (`.Rmd`) that loads the CSV results and generates a polished Word/HTML report for submission.
*   **Shiny Application**: Develop a Shiny dashboard to allow stakeholders to explore key parameters (WTP thresholds, discount rates) without touching the code.
*   **Scenario Manager**: Implement a structured way to define and run multiple scenario analyses (e.g., "High Incidence", "Low Discount Rate") in batch, rather than manually changing globals.
*   **Value of Information (VOI)**: Extend the current EVPI analysis to include EVPPI (Expected Value of Partial Perfect Information) to help prioritize future research.
